📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction



🏢 Machine Learning Internship – SaiKet Systems



📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at SaiKet Systems.


The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company and build predictive models to identify customers who are likely to churn.


By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.



🎯 Objectives

Perform data preprocessing and cleaning

Handle missing values and encode categorical variables

Split dataset into training and testing sets (80:20)

Perform feature selection

Select suitable binary classification models

Train machine learning models

Evaluate models using multiple performance metrics



📈 Results

The final model achieved strong predictive performance and successfully identified high-risk churn customers, enabling actionable business insights.
